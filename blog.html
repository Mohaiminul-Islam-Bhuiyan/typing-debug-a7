            <p>Question:1: Differences between local storage and session storage </p>
            <p>Answer:
                <br>
                In case of sessionStorage the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. On the other hand with localStorage, the data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your web app clears the data.
                <br>
                localStorage provides more spaces for storing data than sessionStorage.

            <p>Question:2: Difference between global scope and block scope</p>
            <p>Answer:
                <br>
                A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. These are called block scopes.
                <br>
                On the other hand, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes.
