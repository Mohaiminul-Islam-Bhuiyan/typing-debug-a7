            <p>Question:1: Differences between local storage and session storage </p>
            <p>Answer:
                <br>
                In case of sessionStorage the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. On the other hand with localStorage, the data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your web app clears the data.
                <br>
                localStorage provides more spaces for storing data than sessionStorage.

            <p>Question:2: Difference between global scope and block scope</p>
            <p>Answer:
                <br>
                A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. These are called block scopes.
                <br>
                On the other hand, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes.

            <p>Question:3: A short description on Javascript event loop</p>
            <p>Answer:
                <br>
                The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
                <br>
                Easy Definition : 
                The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue or Message Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the
                Callback queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.
                <br>
                Easiest explanation : 
                When any Asynchronous event occur such as setTimeOut or promises. Then these task takes some time to complete I/O if they have any. If they completed their I/O or don't have any, then they simply put into message queue or callback queue. Then event loop will firstly execute the 
                call stack tasks and then look for callback or message queue and then execute it.

            <p>Question:4: In how many ways 'undefined' can be get ?</p>
            <p>Answer:
                <br>
                - If a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all. <br>
                - If a non-existing property or method of an object is called. <br>
                - If less argumrnts is passed in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value. <br>
                - An undefined evaluates to false when used in conditional expression.
